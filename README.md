# ABOUT 

This is a small bash script designed to run numerous c files that include a main and functions, written by 2050 stuents.
There are also some directory files to be used for testing. 
The bash script is designed to take c files in, take a tester.cpp file, compile 
and run the tester, then output the results to REPORT.txt (the grade) and
pawprint_output.txt (a report of that students build and output).
